    description:
      'Following the arrest of Herman Webster Mudgett (Dr. H.H. Holmes) in Boston, Detective Frank Geyer and a team of specialists enter the abandoned three-story "Castle" at 63rd and Wallace Street in Chicago. Built for the 1893 World’s Columbian Exposition, the structure hides soundproof gas chambers, doors opening onto brick walls, and greased chutes descending to a basement kiln. What began as an insurance fraud and missing-children investigation unravels a terrifying non-Euclidean architectural machine designed to feed an interdimensional rift beneath Chicago.',
    investigatorIntro:
      'In November 1894, Dr. H.H. Holmes sits in a Philadelphia cell while Detective Frank Geyer arrives in Chicago to trace the missing Pitezel children and vanished World’s Fair stenographers. At the corner of 63rd and Wallace Street looms Holmes’s three-story Castle - a building whose construction crews were fired every two weeks so no living soul would know the layout of its thirty-five windowless second-floor rooms.',

      'During the 1893 World’s Columbian Exposition, over 27 million visitors passed through Chicago, allowing hundreds of disappearances in Englewood to go unrecorded.',

    description:
      'For seven years, the small town of Circleville, Ohio, has been terrorized by hundreds of anonymous letters written in rigid, geometric block capitals and postmarked from Columbus. After school bus driver Mary Gillespie discovers a roadside sign rigged to a box containing a loaded .25-caliber pistol, Sheriff Dwight Radcliff arrests her brother-in-law Paul Freshour and locks him in solitary confinement without pen or paper. Yet the geometric letters keep arriving across town - and inside Freshour’s locked cell. Worse, the fatal 1977 crash of Mary’s husband Ron Gillespie after a single gunshot points to a classified psychotronic carrier wave broadcasting from the town’s central water tower and telephone exchange.',

      'The operational zone encompasses Pickaway County (Circleville, the Westfall school bus route, Route 56 & Florence Chapel Pike, and the central water tower relay).
